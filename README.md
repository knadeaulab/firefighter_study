# Single-Cell Exposomics in Human Blood Reveal Aberrant Immune Impacts of Fire Smoke Exposure in Firefighters 
## Abstract 
Given the global impact of increasing wildfires associated with climate change, understanding the specific mechanisms of how wildfire smoke affects health is critical to developing preventative and targeted therapies. This study investigates the impacts of fire smoke exposure, including PM2.5, toxic metals, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), on the immune systems of firefighters using a single-cell exposomics approach. We collected blood samples from firefighters (n=26) and matched controls (n=31), performing immunophenotyping, DNA methylation profiling, and mass cytometry analyses to identify cellular and epigenetic changes associated with exposure. Key findings include increased immune cell subsets coupled to toxic metal isotopes in exposed individuals and several epigenetic modifications associated with metal isotopes across multiple chromosomes. These results highlight potential molecular targets for intervention in smoke exposure-induced immune dysregulation.
